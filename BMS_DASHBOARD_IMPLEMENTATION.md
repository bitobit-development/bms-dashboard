# BMS Dashboard - Complete Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a production-ready Battery Management System (BMS) Dashboard for monitoring solar battery installations with real-time telemetry data visualization.

## Technology Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 16.0.1 (App Router) with React 19
- **Language**: TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui with Radix UI primitives
- **Charts**: Recharts
- **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Real-time Updates**: Custom polling hook (60-second intervals)

## Implementation Details

### Phase 1: Setup & Dependencies ✅
- Initialized shadcn/ui with default slate theme and CSS variables
- Installed all required components: button, card, badge, avatar, dropdown-menu, navigation-menu, tabs, table, progress, separator, alert, dialog, skeleton, breadcrumb, select, hover-card, tooltip
- Installed dependencies: recharts, @stackframe/stack, date-fns, lucide-react
